            Ndetei Believe it or not, some people cannot do public transport,
            they cannot do taxis and they cannot also drive themselves! They go
            for VIP transport, which is an expensive luxury. To them, it is a
            small price to pay for the status and the special treatment. Read
            more: https://yen.com.gh/106532-vip-transport-ghana.html Every
            individual; poor, rich, or middleclass wants some form of special
            treatment. However, this need can only be maintained by those who

            society or in an event. So how do they look like? How do these
            important people move around because we rarely get to see them in
            the public means compared to the regular people? Read more:
