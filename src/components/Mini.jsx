                The Toyota Coaster was introduced in 1969 as a 17-passenger
                minibus using the same running gear as the Toyota Dyna of the
                time. Early models used the 2.0-litre Toyota R engine with a
                4-speed manual transmission. With its engine rated at 98 PS (72
                kW), a RU19 Coaster could attain a top speed of 110 km/h (68
                mph).[12] Subsequent models used a variety of four and
                six-cylinder diesel and petrol engines, and an option of
                automatic transmission was later introduced. A smaller
                alternative was later introduced at Toyopet Store locations,
                based on the Toyota ToyoAce called the Toyota HiAce which had
                the ability to carry up to 10 passengers but complied with
                Japanese Government regulations concerning exterior dimensions
                and engine displacement. In August 1997, Toyota "Coaster Hybrid
                EV" minibus was launched, ahead of the Prius. The Coaster
                Hybrid, according to Toyota, became its first production hybrid
                vehicle.[13] Production of the Coaster Hybrid continued until
                2007. The LPG Coaster, fueled by liquefied petroleum gas, was
                developed specifically for the Hong Kong market and its air
                pollution problems.[14] The Coaster is widely used in Singapore,
                Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia, but also in the developing
                world for minibus operators in Africa, the Middle East, South
                Asia, the Caribbean, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, Panama,
                and Peru as public transportation. It is the almost the only
                used mini bus in public transportation in Jordan and the brand
                is used to refer to that segment by people and even by the
                government.[citation needed] These buses are imported mainly
                from Asia and have the steering wheel moved to the left and the
                passenger door to the other side.
